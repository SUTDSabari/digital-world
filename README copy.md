# 10.009 Digital World 2018
My notebooks for 10.009 Introduction to Digital World, Spring 2018

One notebook contains code that I have written for homework. Nothing too see here, I just want to save work writings somewhere. The other notebook contains things I have learnt during tutorials (as I have been using Python for quite a while) already, together with pointers that we should take note of. This serves a revision notes for me to score well in exams.
